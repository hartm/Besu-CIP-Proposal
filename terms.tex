\section{Extra Terms} \label{sec:terms}
This plan is an opt-in additional incentivization plan for execution-layer clients. Participation in this plan and the amount of locked funds available in the plan will have no bearing on future client grant decisions. Prerequisites of participation in this plan are successful participation in multi-client testnets and generally demonstrating production readiness at all times.

Additionally, the EF expects the major stakeholders contributing to Hyperledger Besu to agree to participate in the program, and come to consensus on distribution schemes for incentives once received.

In general and especially in the event of exceptional and unforeseen scenarios concerning Hyperledger Besu, the teams contributing to Besu, the Hyperledger Foundation, the Ethereum roadmap, and/or the Ethereum mainnet, the EF is solely responsible for deciding how to award withdrawal credentials and/or restructure the terms of this incentive plan at any time.

Such exceptional scenarios include, but are not limited to, the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Separate teams merging into one
\item Teams contributting to Hyperledger Besu splitting into two
\item Teams contributting to Hyperledger Besu ceasing the maintenence of a component (e.g. validator client) or the entirety of their software
\item Node operators having to be replaced
\item Hyperledger Besu, or a subset of it which supports the Ethereum mainnet, no longer being part of the Hyperledger Foundation
\item Ethereum roadmap radically changing such that the milestones no longer reflect achievable goals
\item Ethereum mainnet has extended issues with stability, finality, or otherwise proper function
\item Ethereum mainnet undergoes a contentious hardfork
\end{itemize}
